<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em><strong>Event-driven programming</strong></em> - writing programs in which the algorithms are based on user interaction; the user invokes events (clicking, typing text, selecting text, etc.) which causes the program algorithm to perform certain tasks.&nbsp; (Typically, events are invoked by the 'user' but events can be invoked automatically by program such as a Form's "Load" event or a Timer's "Tick" event.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em><strong>Event procedures</strong></em> - self-contained blocks of code that require some type of stimulus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em><strong>Comments (remarks)</strong></em> - notes left in the code, by the programmer(s,) to help describe the function of the program.&nbsp; Comments make it easier to find problems within code, or add different features to the code at a later time.&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I feel it is important that you comment your code!</strong></span></span></p>
